## Install Instructions

In order to use the application the necessary npm dependencies need to be installed with:
```
npm install
```
Next the server needs to be started with:
```
npm start
```

Finally you can reach the project on port:3000 but it should open automatically for you.

## Usage

The application is a single-page app.
You can click on the markers, to see what the places are, and see who liked them most recently.
The same functionality is avilable to you if you use the side-bar located on the left, just click on the name of the places.

You can narrow down your search by using the provided search box. Both on the map and in the listed items below only the places will show up, which match your search query.

## Contributing

Any pull requests will be considered in order to improve performance, quality or overall feel of the application - or to squish some bugs if found. Please note that this repository is not monitored daily, so some delays are expected.

## License

The project is open source, however the basics and the project instructions were provided through Udacity via the Front End Developer Nanodegree course.

## Kudos

* A *huge* thanks to Edoh Kodjo - his useful guide on the Udacity site helped me tremendously
* One of the third party apps used for this project was Foursquare's API, to get more details about the locations, venue - it is via this app, that the street name is displayed
* Another third party API used in this project was from https://randomuser.me/ - thanks for letting me use it for free! (also check out their site, it has the Konami code implemented)
